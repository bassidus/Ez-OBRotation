# Ez OBRotation

**Ez OBRotation** is a lightweight World of Warcraft utility designed to bridge the gap between "One Button Rotation" (OBR) setups and your muscle memory. While standard OBR tell you *what* to press, it hides the actual keybind associated with that action. 

This addon dynamically pulls your current keybinds and overlays them directly onto your OBR buttons, ensuring you never have to guess which key is mapped to your next move.

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Overlays:** Automatically displays keybind text on OBR buttons.
* **Interface Support:** Works out-of-the-box with the **Blizzard Default UI** and **Bartender4**.
* **Instant Updates:** Reflects keybind changes immediately without requiring a UI reload.
* **Performance First:** Zero impact on FPS, with a minimal memory footprint.

## 🛠 Installation

2.  Extract the folder into your `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns` directory.
